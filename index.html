      <p id="tribute-info" class="indent">Martin Luther King Jr. was a Baptist minister and activist who played a central role in the American civil rights movement. Born Michael King Jr. in 1929, he became involved in the movement after Rosa Parks' arrest for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man in 1955. King led the Montgomery bus boycott, a year-long protest that challenged segregation on public buses. The success of the boycott brought King national recognition as a spokesperson for civil rights.</p><p id="tribute-info" class="indent">King co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957 to promote nonviolent protests in the fight for racial equality. He organized numerous marches and protests throughout the 1960s, including the March on Washington in 1963, where he delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. King's leadership and activism helped achieve major civil rights gains, such as the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He was assassinated in 1968.</p>
